        1. Eat the local food
        </div>
 
        
            <p>One of my biggest regrets from the first year of my travels was that I wasn’t brave enough to try any of the local food. I was raised a picky eater and that, combined with debilitating anxiety and an eating disorder, led to me believing that I would either hate or be allergic to anything I hadn’t tried before.</p>

            <p>I was so, so wrong.</p>

            <p>Food is now my absolute favourite way to get to know a place better.</p>

            <p>I love trying new things, and I’ve found a thousand amazing dishes that I never would have discovered if I’d continue to eat from supermarkets around the world. Trying new food isn’t scary, and you’ll build your confidence up as you fall in love with more and more things.</p>

    <p>Try everything, even if you have no idea what it is. I promise you won’t regret it. Or fall straight into anaphylactic shock.</p>

       2. Travel insurance is everything
Seriously. 
        </div>
    
        
            <p> If you do only one thing before you leave, make it getting travel insurance. I’ve heard far too many horror stories of travellers injuring themselves in remote places and ending up in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt. Don’t think that it won’t happen to you, because you know those travellers thought that, too.</p>

            <p>I’ve used <a href="https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-insurance/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrrXtBRCKARIsAMbU6bFhSN6-aqyM_Q29h6h6wbF3oGCcC8uCcN_Q0NQqLwF-1CMUCgR6v9oaAnJaEALw_wcB" target="_blank">World Nomads</a> for my travel insurance provider for six years and recommend them to everyone I know. They were fantastic to deal with when making a claim.</p>

      3. Learn a few words of the language in every country you visit
        </div>
 
        
            <p>You’ll gain more respect from the locals if you can at least say hello, please, sorry, and thank you. On that note, remember: if you don’t speak the language, it’s your problem, not theirs. And please don’t start speaking louder to make yourself understood. Try miming instead, or using a translation app on your phone.</p></div>

           <div>   <div id="unicorn">
     4. Don’t be put off a destination if you can’t find much information about it
        </div>
   
               <p> When I decided to see if it was possible to visit the <a href="places.html" target="_blank">Japan on a budget</a> back in 2014, information was so sparse that I couldn’t even find a photo of the cities I’d decided to visit. Well, that trip was one of my highlights of the past eight years and I’m so glad I went, despite not being able to find any information online. And the advantage to that lack of information was getting to be the only tourist on an entire island — I had the whole beach to myself!
</p> 
<p>If you know it’s safe to travel somewhere, but can’t find out much else, go for it. It’s probably far easier to get there than you think. And if not, it makes for a good story.</p></div>
        
        <div>     <div id="unicorn">
   5. Leaving your comfort zone is the best thing you can do for yourself
        </div>
     
        
            <p>I cite leaving my comfort zone as the number one way in which travel has helped me. It was leaving my comfort zone that gave me confidence in my abilities as a traveller. It helped me to overcome my anxiety disorder by showing me the things I was panicking about rarely happened — and if they did, they were never as bad as they thought they would be. And it introduced me to new experiences — most of which I unexpectedly loved!</p></div>
    
         <div>     <div id="unicorn">
     6. Don’t change your currency at the airport
        </div>
        
            <p>That’s where you’ll get the worst exchange rates.</p></div> 
        
      <div>       <div id="unicorn">
    7. Start saving early and bring more money than you think you’ll need
        </div>
    
        <p>
It’s good to have a budget to stick to, but most people tend to go over. Start saving as soon as possible (like, now) and aim to bring more money than you think you’ll need. The more money you have, the more you’ll be able to treat yourself to nicer accommodation, splurge on fun tours, and not spend your entire trip worrying that you’ll run out of cash.</p></div>

          <div>   <div id="unicorn">
  8. Get your phone unlocked before you leave
        </div>
 
        <p>
With an unlocked phone, you’ll be able to buy local SIM cards and access cheap data as you travel. Cheap data means getting to use Google Maps when you’re lost, being able to Snapchat your way around a city, and being easily contactable by your new friends.</p></div>
    
          <div>   <div id="unicorn">
 9. Invest in a good camera
        </div>
    
        <p>
Your photos will be some of your best memories, so invest in a good camera. And, of course, take the time to understand how it works before you leave.</p></div>

         <div>    <div id="unicorn">
10. Get lost on purpose
        </div>
   
        <p>Sometimes getting lost is the best way to make awesome discoveries about a place. Sometimes it just plain sucks, that’s true. But if you’ve got a spare day in a place and don’t know what to do, start by picking a random direction and following it.</p></div>
